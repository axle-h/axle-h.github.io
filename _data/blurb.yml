  I have led multiple teams and delivered many full stack projects from design to production.
  I have a strong background in mathematics, statistics and data science, which has accelerated my career through some really interesting and complex projects.
  Most of all, I enjoy designing simple, scalable solutions to complex problems in an agile team.
  I like wearing shorts, running and retro gaming.
