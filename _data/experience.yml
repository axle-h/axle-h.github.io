    I joined MoJ digital as a senior developer, looking to broaden my experience of working with enterprise scale applications, with thousands of users that have diverse accessibility needs.
    I also took on a tech challenge at MoJ having less experience with their tech stack and no experience working with Government Digital Service frameworks.
    I have been technical lead on multiple projects, which have been released through alpha, beta and live phases.
    I have integrated with legacy monolithic applications and supported a general strategy for modern platform migration.
    Much of my work is available publicly on GitHub.

  from: JAN 2020
  to: FEB 2021

    IN-PART provides a digital partnering platform connecting university research with industry R&D.
    Virtually all technology at IN-PART was new to me in a commercial context including React, next.js and Node.js (at scale).
    I saw the move as a challenge and learning experience coupled with validation of my processes and knowledge against a team with far more experience than me in their chosen technologies.
    I assumed the role of security and data platform expert, leading on the architecture of OIDC and serverless data processing pipelines across the platform.

    Westfield Health is a not-for-profit provider of contributory health schemes and health & wellbeing services in the process of migrating many legacy business processes online.
    I provided technical leadership for a feature team responsible for multiple microservices and relevant domain ownership.
    I also led decisions that directed the platform as a whole and distributed processes, training and libraries to build conformance across all teams.
    I became the primary contact and technical owner for all things security, platform, serverless, UX/client technologies and mobile development.

    At t-mac, I provided technical leadership for a big data, machine learning & analytics team responsible for processing IoT time series data at scale, presenting analytics onto customer dashboards and providing automated insights into portfolio performance.
    I led the project to architect the platform that supported all of this, which was built from technologies such as Cassandra, Spark and Kafka.
    I used primarily Scala based JDK software to deploy a mixture of custom and off-the-shelf machine learning algorithms at scale.
    I also worked across the web stack including .NET Core on Docker Swarm with Angular on the front end.

    Alpharooms is an online travel agent with a stack built with .NET Framework, SQL Server and MongoDB and based on a service orientated architecture.
    Major challenges were operating efficiently at scale on AWS, maintaining SEO performance, managing asynchronous, external processes at scale and presenting everything with a UX aligned to maximising revenue.
    Whilst much of the technologies and packages I used at Alpharooms are becoming obsolete, the skills I picked up have been extremely valuable.

    I started my career as an Analyst at Experian Decision Analytics.
    At Experien I realised that what little software development I was responsible for was what kept me driven and set me apart from my peers.
    This responsibility was slowly taken away from me as I progressed, pushing me to move to software development full time.
