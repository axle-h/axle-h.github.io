    I joined MoJ digital as a senior developer, looking to broaden my experience of working with enterprise scale applications, with thousands of users that have diverse accessibility needs.
    I also took on a tech challenge at MoJ having less experience with their tech stack and no experience working with Government Digital Service frameworks.
    I have been technical lead on multiple projects, which have been released through alpha, beta and live phases.
    Much of my work is available publicly on GitHub.

  at: IN-PART

  from: JAN 2020
  to: FEB 2021
  description: >
    IN-PART is a small company with a startup culture that provides a digital partnering platform connecting
    university research with industry R&D. Virtually all technology at IN-PART was new to me in a commercial
    context including React, next.js and Node.js (at scale). I saw the move as a challenge and learning experience
    coupled with validation of my processes and knowledge against a team with far more experience than me in
    their chosen technologies. I have once again assumed the role of security and data platform expert and
    been rolling out OIDC and serverless data processing pipelines across the platform as required.
    Whilst I have enjoyed getting back into coding to a far higher degree, I am continuing to lead projects,
    plan and distribute architectural work across the team and develop my peers.

  from: JAN 2018
  to: JAN 2020
  description: >
    Westfield Health is a not-for-profit provider of contributory health schemes and health & wellbeing services
    in the process of migrating many legacy business processes online via a greenfield platform.
    I provided technical leadership for a feature team responsible for a selection of microservices built into
    the larger platform. I also led decisions that affected the platform as a whole and distributed processes
    and libraries to build conformance across all teams. My team was well known for our velocity, quality and
    for shaping cross-team knowledge & design. I quickly became first contact and technical owner for all things
    security, platform, serverless, UX/client technologies and mobile development.

  at: t-mac Technologies

  from: NOV 2015
  to: JAN 2018
  description: >
    t-mac Technologies digitally services thousands of on-site proprietary IoT devices and automatic meter readers
    resulting in the consumption of approximately 250 million time series data observations per day.
    The core responsibility of the team for which I provided technical leadership was to process this big
    data into analytical insights which were to be presented on customer dashboards. I led the project to
    architect this modern data platform, which was built from technologies such as Cassandra, Spark and Kafka.
    I used primarily Scala based JDK software to deploy a mixture of custom and off-the-shelf machine learning
    algorithms at scale. I also worked across the web stack including .NET Core on Docker Swarm with Angular on the front end.

  from: MAR 2014
  to: NOV 2015
  description: >
    Alpharooms is an online travel agent with a modern (for the time) stack built with .NET Framework,
    SQL Server and MongoDB and based on a service orientated architecture. I worked as a software developer
    enjoying a more senior role towards the end of my stay. Major challenges were operating efficiently at
    scale on AWS, maintaining SEO performance, managing asynchronous, external processes at scale and presenting
    everything with a UX aligned to maximising revenue. Whilst much of the technologies and packages I used at
    Alpharooms are becoming obsolete, the skills I picked up have been extremely valuable.

  from: DEC 2012
  to: MAR 2014
  description: >
    I took my first software development job in a multi-disciplined team at Technolog, an electronics manufacturer
    in the utilities industry. I worked primarily with the data infrastructure that supports a network of data
    loggers and automatic meter reading systems. I basically learnt to program as part of a team, picking up
    concepts such as the importance of design patterns and test driven development.

    I started my career as an Analyst at Experian Decision Analytics. Due to my previous experience with Experian
    systems during my placement year, I was immediately assigned to a large software testing project.
    I was solely responsible for creating suitable test scripts, reporting bugs and providing in- depth analytical
    support to developers. At Experien I realised that what little software development I was responsible for
    was what kept me driven and set me apart from my peers. This responsibility was slowly taken away from me
    as I progressed, pushing me to move to software development full time.
