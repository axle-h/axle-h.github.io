    I like to choose the most appropriate for the project and team, rolling server side rendering or even a native app where required.

    I have developed machine learning at scale with open source tools like Apache Cassandra, Spark and Kafka.
    My strong background in statistics means I am equally confident in the development of custom algorithms as I am with dropping in off-the-shelf solutions.

    I try to diversify my platform experience but prefer, in no particular order:
    JDK (incl. Kotlin, Scala, Gradle, Spring), .NET Core/5+, Node.js and the (modern) browser.
    I'm looking to improve my Go, Rust and C++ skills.
    I seem to be avoiding the python & PHP platforms but am open to anything that involves learning new stuff!
