                                Specializing in .NET Core microservices orchestrated on Kubernetes or NodeJS running serverless via AWS SAM.

                                To me, infrastructure as code seems more natural than using the AWS console.

                                for a feature squad responsible for product management.
                                My team is well known for our velocity, quality and for shaping cross-team knowledge &amp; processes.
                                I have lead multi team projects to modernise and standardise client applications and provide asynchronous messaging via MassTransit on AWS SaaS.
                                I have also led a series of major security projects to provide single sign on via OIDC to modern &amp; legacy internal software and also external partners.

                                resulting in a consumption of approximately 250 million time series data observations per day.
                                The core responsibility of the team for which I provided technical leadership was to process
                                this big data into analytical insights &amp; predictions to be presented to customers via bespoke dashboards.
                                My highlight was to successfully lead a massive project to port the entire architecture 
                                from a legacy, relational backed system to a modern big data platform based on Apache Cassandra, Spark and Kafka.
                                I have focused my efforts on producing quality and decoupled software  that maintains maximum reliability,
                                whilst building efficiency that has been used to augment the system with new analytical and machine learning
                                based features. I have also been a web developer, integrating new data platform features across the full stack.

                                I was a software developer at Alpharooms, an e-commerce travel agent. I worked in the
                                infrastructure of the fully responsive, SEO optimised consumer facing front end and back office
                                systems. I worked full stack and became a leading producer in my team whilst also enjoying a more
                                senior role towards the end of my stay. Whilst much of the technologies I used at Alpharooms are
                                quickly becoming obsolete (monolithic MVC applications on the full-fat .NET Framework and
                                Knockout on the client) the skills I picked up have been extremely valuable. Everything was running
                                on AWS and it was a constant battle to scale out systems whilst balancing cost with user experience.
                                Security was also a top concern and this fed into some really interesting projects for me
                                at future positions. This time also introduced me to proper cross business agile development, the concepts
                                and expectations of which I have brought with me.

                                the utilities industry. I worked primarily with the data infrastructure that supports a network of data
                                loggers and automatic meter reading systems. I basically learnt to program as part of a team,

                                After my degree, I returned to Experian Decision Analytics in a more analytical role. Due to my
                                previous experience with Experian systems, I was immediately assigned to a large software testing
                                project. I was solely responsible for creating suitable test scripts, reporting bugs and providing in-
                                depth analytical support to developers. Due to my highly technical approach to projects and support,
                                something that differentiated me from my peers, I became a regular and successful technical contact
                                for training and development within my department.

                                market leading credit reference bureau. My main responsibilities were to maintain, schedule and
