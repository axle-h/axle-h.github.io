                Westfield Health is a not-for-profit provider of contributory health schemes and health &amp; wellbeing
                services in the process of migrating many legacy business processes online via a greenfield platform.
                I provided technical leadership for a feature team responsible for a selection of microservices built
                into the larger platform.
                I also led decisions that affected the platform as a whole and distributed processes and libraries to
                build conformance across all teams.
                My team was well known for our velocity, quality and for shaping cross-team knowledge &amp; design.
                Amongst many CRUD based projects, interesting projects include:
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>SSO</b> a full stack, OIDC based security system with subject authentication across multiple
                platforms,
                system-to-system authentication, distributed role based authorization, federation of AD identities and
                federation out to external partners.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Insurance</b> an implementation of a cryptographically secure, high performance, distributed ledger
                acting as the single source of truth for personal health insurance account balances.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Customer Portal</b> a modern, Angular based client application for managing customer interactions
                deployed to the web and mobile platforms via Cordova.
              </p>
              <p>
                Major challenges at Westfield Health were building acceptance of modern development processes across
                legacy teams,
                leading a team consisting of >50% remote members,
                managing priorities to keep other teams unblocked e.g. deploying skeleton API's via OpenAPI before
                functionally ready
                and providing a viable migration path from the legacy platform.

                Utilitywise digitally services thousands of on-site proprietary IoT devices and automatic meter readers
                resulting in the consumption of approximately 250 million time series data observations per day.
                The core responsibility of the team for which I provided technical leadership was to process
                this big data into analytical insights via machine learning to be presented on customer dashboards.
                I led the project to architect this modern data platform, which was build from technologies such as
                Cassandra, Spark &amp; Kafka.
                I used primarily Scala based JDK software to deploy a mixture of custom and off-the-shelf machine
                learning algorithms at scale.
                I also worked across the web stack including .NET Core on Docker Swarm with Angular on the front end.

                SQL Server &amp; MongoDB and based on a service orientated architecture.
                I worked as a software developer enjoying a more senior role towards the end of my stay.
                Major challenges were operating efficiently at scale on AWS, maintaining SEO performance,
                managing asynchronous, external processes at scale and presenting everything with a UX aligned to
                generating revenue.
                Whilst much of the technologies I used at Alpharooms are becoming obsolete (monolithic MVC applications
                on the full-fat .NET Framework with
                Knockout on the client) the skills I picked up have been extremely valuable.

                After my degree, I returned to Experian Decision Analytics in a more analytical role. Due to my
                previous experience with Experian systems, I was immediately assigned to a large software testing
                project. I was solely responsible for creating suitable test scripts, reporting bugs and providing in-
                depth analytical support to developers. Due to my highly technical approach to projects and support,
                something that differentiated me from my peers, I became a regular and successful technical contact
                for training and development within my department.
