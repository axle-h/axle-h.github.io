title: Next.js on GitHub Pages
---

I've been doing a bit of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) recently and really fell for [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).
It does the best job I've seen so far in a UI library at removing the need for CSS (without being Tailwind 🤢).
I didn't have any other UI stuff lined up to work on so thought I'd port this site over to it.
Problem is.
Chakra is a React component library.
For React to have a decent FCP, to work with SEO or to have a social preview, my experience tells me to use Next.js.
But Next.js needs a server and that conflicts with my wallet, which would be much happier with static HTML+CSS on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

That just won't do. Every developer needs an over engineered personal blog site. Why else would there be a meme for that.

## What about Gatsby?

First I looked at [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Let me share my experience.

```shell
npm init gatsby
# Enter -> Enter -> defaults etc
```

> **Nice!** They have a really decent npm template. But it did take a while and why didn't I see a vulnerability audit?

```shell
cd my-gatsby-site
npm audit # 😱 😱 😱 😱
```

![gatsby vulnerabilities](gatsby-vulns.png)

Bearing in mind that this is a freshly templated project, effectively a toy for showcasing the platform,
there were 23 vulnerabilities, of which 1 was critical and 8 were high.
I've worked with some crusty old Node projects and the only time I'd ever see anything like that was when dusting off something we hadn't deployed in maybe a year or more.

I had a look myself and the [gatsby package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby?activeTab=dependencies) has 168 dependencies.
This is an order of magnitude more than Next.js, which [is currently at 16](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next?activeTab=dependencies).
Maybe it's just impossible to remain vulnerability free with this many dependencies?
Whatever the case, it seems Gatsby is at meme status on npm for depending on **EVERYTHING** and so not something I'd fancy maintaining as a dependency.

I read some stuff on Redit about the vulnerabilities not being in the runtime but how would you know?
It'd be like crying wolf with every report.
Plus I just couldn't put the poor GitHub dependabot through it 🤖.

## Next.js SSG

Luckily, it turns out that since I last looked, Next.js has a new router, runs on React server components by default and fully supports static site generation.
That sounds like it'll do the job perfectly then.

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest
```

```
✔ What is your project named? … my-app
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? … No
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory? … No
✔ Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) … Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? … No
Creating a new Next.js app in /Users/alex/projects/my-app.
```

How relieved was I to see "found 0 vulnerabilities".
Plus unlike Gatsby, I didn't have to run an audit myself.

To enable SSG you need to configure Next.js.

```js
// next.config.mjs
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    output: 'export'
};

export default nextConfig;
```

## MDX

I like the convenience and portability of writing in markdown.
It takes a bit of setting up in Next.js but I think it's worth it.
Also, since we're using React we may as well use [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

Next.js supports rendering MDX with the app router via [@next/mdx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx).
But since a blog site would need a "list of posts" abstraction, a better fit would be [MDX remote](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx#remote-mdx).

Create a `posts` folder as a sibling to the `app` folder and drop a markdown file in with some frontmatter e.g.

```markdown
---
# posts/my-first-post.mdx
title: My first post
slug: my-first-post
date: 2024-04-09
---

This is my *first* post.

Here's a table.

| Month    | Savings |
| -------- | ------- |
| January  | $250    |
| February | $80     |
| March    | $420    |
```

Add the dependencies.

```shell
# Note remark-gfm is optional if you would like to
# use GitHub flavoured markdown e.g. tables.
# The pinned version are required as of April 2024
# as remark-gfm 4.0.0 breaks compatibility with next-mdx-remote.
npm i next-mdx-remote@^4 remark-gfm@^3
```

Next we need to read the posts from disc and compile their MDX into a React cache.
Create this in `posts/index.ts`

```ts
// posts/index.ts
import { readdir, readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'
import path from 'node:path'
import { compileMDX } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc'
import { cache, ReactElement } from 'react'
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'

interface Post {
  title: string
  slug: string
  date: Date
  content: ReactElement
}

type PostFrontmatter = Pick<Post, 'title' | 'slug' | 'date'>

async function getPost(filename: string): Promise<Post> {
  const source = await readFile(path.join('posts', filename), 'utf8')
  const { frontmatter, content } = await compileMDX<PostFrontmatter>({
    source,
    options: {
      parseFrontmatter: true,
      mdxOptions: {
        remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
      },
    },
  })

  return { ...frontmatter, content }
}

// note this is cached so we can call it as many times as we like
export const allPosts = cache(async () => {
  const files = await readdir('posts')
  const posts = await Promise.all(
    files.filter((file) => path.extname(file) === '.mdx').map(getPost)
  )
  return posts.toSorted((p1, p2) => p2.date.getTime() - p1.date.getTime())
})
```

Next we need a list of posts.
Replace the content of `app/page.tsx` with:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
import { allPosts } from '@/posts'
import Link from 'next/link'

export default async function PostsPage() {
  const posts = await allPosts()
  return (
    <>
      <h1>My Blog</h1>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <div key={post.slug}>
          <Link href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  )
}
```

And finally a route for displaying a post.

```tsx
// app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx
import { allPosts } from '@/posts'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'

export default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const posts = await allPosts()
  const post = posts.find((p) => p.slug === params.slug) || null
  if (!post) {
    return notFound()
  }
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      {post.content}
    </>
  )
}

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await allPosts()
  return posts.map((post) => ({ slug: post.slug }))
}
```

Start the app:

```shell
npm run dev
```

And navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
You should see something like this:

![posts](posts-page.png)

Click the link and you should see the rendered MDX in all it's glory:

![post](post-page.png)

## Chakra UI

Chakra UI integrates with Next.js easily, first add the dependencies:

```shell
npm i @chakra-ui/react @chakra-ui/next-js @emotion/react @emotion/styled framer-motion
```

Chakra UI needs to wrap all content in a `<ChakraProvider>` so you need:

```tsx
// app/providers.tsx
'use client'

import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

export function Providers({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <ChakraProvider>{children}</ChakraProvider>
}
```

Next, use the `Providers` component in your layouts.

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx
import { Providers } from './providers'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode,
}) {
  return (
    <html lang='en'>
      <body>
        <Providers>{children}</Providers>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

You can plug Chakra components into `next-mdx-remote` by providing a components option.

```tsx
// posts/mdx-components.tsx
import { Text, Table, Thead, Tr, Td, Th, Tfoot } from '@chakra-ui/react'

// you can override anything here, this is just an example
export const components = {
  p: (props: any) => <Text {...props} my={4} />,
  table: Table,
  thead: Thead,
  tr: Tr,
  td: Td,
  th: Th,
  tfoot: Tfoot,
}
```

To wire this up, in `posts/index.ts`, pass the exported `components` object as a property in the object passed to the `compileMDX` function.

Then replace the bare `<h1>` in `app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx` with a Chakra `<Heading>`. Reload and you should see something like this:

![chakra post](chakra-post-page.png)

This is just a start, there's plenty you can do with the MDX rendering to properly support styled headings, lists, Next.js client side links, code highlighting, images etc.

## Static site generation

You should then be able to demo the static site:

```sh
npm run build
npx serve out
```

And navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

I'd open the browser console to make sure nothing wacky is going on with the React hydration.

## GitHub pages

Getting started with GtHub pages is pretty easy.

1. Follow the [getting started guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).
   This gets you a default site setup with Jekyll. But I hated this as I needed to run Ruby to see it locally.
2. Set pages up to publish from the `main` branch with [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site).
3. Use this action.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/main.yml
name: Deploy to Pages

on:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
  push:
    branches: [main]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  # Build job
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "21"
          cache: 'npm'
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
        with:
          static_site_generator: next
      - name: Restore cache
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |
            .next/cache
          # Generate a new cache whenever packages or source files change.
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}-${{ hashFiles('**.[jt]s', '**.[jt]sx') }}
          # If source files changed but packages didn't, rebuild from a prior cache.
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-nextjs-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}-
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
        env:
          ENABLE_ANALYTICS: true
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  # Deployment job
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

Commit and you should ™️ be able to see on GitHub Actions:

![deploy from action](action.png)

If you need a working example, this site is built with Next.js and deployed to GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions from my repository [https://github.com/axle-h/axle-h.github.io](https://github.com/axle-h/axle-h.github.io).

Happy over-engineered blogging 😀.
